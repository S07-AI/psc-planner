8 School of Engineering Statements
8.1 Instructor's Role and Responsibility to Students
The instructor’s role is to develop and deliver course material in ways that facilitate learning
for a variety of students. Selected lecture notes will be made available to students on
Courselink but these are not intended to be stand-alone course notes. Some written lecture
notes will be presented only in class. During lectures, the instructor will expand and explain
the content of notes and provide example problems that supplement posted notes.
Scheduled classes will be the principal venue to provide information and feedback for tests
and labs.
8.2 Students' Learning Responsibilities
Students are expected to take advantage of the learning opportunities provided during
lectures and lab sessions. Students, especially those having difficulty with the course content,
should also make use of other resources recommended by the instructor. Students who do
(or may) fall behind due to illness, work, or extra-curricular activities are advised to keep the
instructor informed. This will allow the instructor to recommend extra resources in a timely
manner and/or provide consideration if appropriate.
8.3 Lab Safety
Safety is critically important to the School and is the responsibility of all members of the
School: faculty, staff and students. As a student in a lab course you are responsible for taking
all reasonable safety precautions and following the lab safety rules specific to the lab you are
working in. In addition, you are responsible for reporting all safety issues to the laboratory
supervisor, GTA or faculty responsible.
9 University Statements
9.1 Email Communication
As per university regulations, all students are required to check their e-mail account regularly:
e-mail is the official route of communication between the University and its students.
9.2 When You Cannot Meet a Course Requirement
When you find yourself unable to meet an in-course requirement because of illness or
Page 13 of16
ENGG*1420 C01 W24 v2.00
compassionate reasons please advise the course instructor (or designated person, such as a
teaching assistant) in writing, with your name, id#, and e-mail contact. The grounds for
Academic Consideration are detailed in the Undergraduate and Graduate Calendars.

9.3 Drop Date
Students will have until the last day of classes to drop courses without academic penalty. The
deadline to drop two-semester courses will be the last day of classes in the second semester.
This applies to all students (undergraduate, graduate and diploma) except for Doctor of
Veterinary Medicine and Associate Diploma in Veterinary Technology (conventional and
alternative delivery) students. The regulations and procedures for course registration are
available in their respective Academic Calendars.

9.4 Copies of Out-of-class Assignments
Keep paper and/or other reliable back-up copies of all out-of-class assignments: you may be
asked to resubmit work at any time.
9.5 Accessibility
The University promotes the full participation of students who experience disabilities in their
academic programs. To that end, the provision of academic accommodation is a shared
responsibility between the University and the student.
When accommodations are needed, the student is required to first register with Student
Accessibility Services (SAS). Documentation to substantiate the existence of a disability is
required; however, interim accommodations may be possible while that process is underway.
Accommodations are available for both permanent and temporary disabilities. It should be
noted that common illnesses such as a cold or the flu do not constitute a disability.
Page 14 of16
ENGG*1420 C01 W24 v2.00
Use of the SAS Exam Centre requires students to make a booking at least 14 days in advance,
and no later than November 1 (fall), March 1 (winter) or July 1 (summer). Similarly, new or
changed accommodations for online quizzes, tests and exams must be approved at least a
week ahead of time.
For Guelph students, information can be found on the SAS website
https://www.uoguelph.ca/sas
For Ridgetown students, information can be found on the Ridgetown SAS website
https://www.ridgetownc.com/services/accessibilityservices.cfm
9.6 Academic Integrity
The University of Guelph is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic
integrity, and it is the responsibility of all members of the University community-faculty, staff,
and students-to be aware of what constitutes academic misconduct and to do as much as
possible to prevent academic offences from occurring. University of Guelph students have
the responsibility of abiding by the University's policy on academic misconduct regardless of
their location of study; faculty, staff, and students have the responsibility of supporting an
environment that encourages academic integrity. Students need to remain aware that
instructors have access to and the right to use electronic and other means of detection.
Please note: Whether or not a student intended to commit academic misconduct is not
relevant for a finding of guilt. Hurried or careless submission of assignments does not excuse
students from responsibility for verifying the academic integrity of their work before
submitting it. Students who are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part could be
construed as an academic offence should consult with a faculty member or faculty advisor.

9.7 Recording of Materials
Presentations that are made in relation to course work - including lectures - cannot be
recorded or copied without the permission of the presenter, whether the instructor, a student,
or guest lecturer. Material recorded with permission is restricted to use for that course unless
further permission is granted.
9.8 Resources
The Academic Calendars are the source of information about the University of Guelph’s
procedures, policies, and regulations that apply to undergraduate, graduate, and diploma
programs.

9.9 Illness
Medical notes will not normally be required for singular instances of academic consideration,
although students may be required to provide supporting documentation for multiple missed
assessments or when involving a large part of a course (e.g.. final exam or major
assignment).
